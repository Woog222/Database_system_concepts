Write the following queries in relational algebra, using the university schema.

---

#### a. Find the ID and name of each instructor in the Physics department.

$\Pi_{ID,name}(\sigma_{dept\_name='Physics'}(instructor))$

#### b. Find the ID and name of each instructor in a department located in the building "Watson".

$
dept\_watson \leftarrow \sigma_{building='Watson'}(department) \\ 
\Pi_{ID,name}(dept\_watson \bowtie_N instructor)
$

#### c. Find the ID and name of each student who has taken at least one course in the "Comp. Sci." department.

$
\text{compCourse} \leftarrow  \sigma_{dept\_name='Comp. Sci.'}(course) \\
\text{takesComp} \leftarrow takes \bowtie_N compCourse \\
\Pi_{ID, name}(takesComp \bowtie_N student)
$


#### d. Find the ID and name of each student who has taken at least one course section in the year 2018.

$
\text{a} \leftarrow \sigma_{year=2018}(takes) \bowtie_N student \\
\Pi_{ID, name}(a)
$

#### e. Find the ID and name of each student who has not taken any course section in the year 2018.

$
\text{a} \leftarrow \sigma_{year=2018}(takes) \bowtie_N student \\
\Pi_{ID,name}(student) - \Pi_{ID, name}(a)
$
