### 2.14

Consider the employee database of Figure 2.17. Give an expression in the relational algebra to express each of the following queries:

| Assuming the schema below.
```
employee(ID, person_name, street, city)
works(ID, company_name, salary)
company(company_name, city)
```
---

#### a. Find the ID and name of each employee who works for "BigBank".
$
\Pi_{ID,\ person\_name}(employee \bowtie_{N} \sigma_{company\_name='BigBank'}(works))
$


#### b. Find the ID, name, and city of residence of each employee who works for "BigBank".
$
\Pi_{ID, \ person\_name, \ street, \ city}(employee \bowtie_{N} \sigma_{company\_name='BigBank'}(works))
$


#### c. Find the ID, name, street address, and city of residence of each employee who works for "BigBank" and earns more than $10000.
$
\Pi_{ID,\ person\_name,\ street,\ city}(employee \bowtie_{N} \sigma_{company\_name='BigBank'\ \wedge \ salary > 10000}(works))
$

#### d. Find the ID and name of each employee in this database who lives in the same city as the company for which she or he works.


$
a \leftarrow employee \bowtie_N works \\
b \leftarrow a \bowtie_{a.city = company.city \ \wedge \ company.company_name = a.company_name }company \\
\Pi_{ID, person\_name}(b)
$
