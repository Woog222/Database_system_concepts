| Assuming the schema below. (Above diagram does not contain ID attiribute.)
```
employee(ID, person_name, street, city)
works(ID, company_name, salary)
company(company_name, city)
```

---

#### a. Find the ID and name of each employee who does not work for "BigBank.
$
a \leftarrow \Pi_{ID, \ person\_name}(employee) \\
b \leftarrow \Pi_{ID, \ person\_name}(\sigma_{company\_name = 'BigBank'}(employee \bowtie_{N} works)) \\
b - a
$

#### b. Find the ID and name of each employee who earns at least as much as every employee in the database.

$
a \leftarrow \Pi_{ID, \ person\_name}(employee) \\
ee \leftarrow employee \bowtie_{N} works \\
b \leftarrow \sigma_{S.salary < T.salary}(\rho_{S}(ee) \times \rho_{T}(ee)) \\
c\leftarrow \rho_{(ID, \ person\_name)}(\Pi_{S.ID, \ S.person\_name}(b)) \\
c-a
