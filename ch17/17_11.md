The definition of a schedule assumes that operations can be totally ordered by time. Consider a database system that runs on a system with multiple processors, where it is not always possible to establish an exact ordering between operations that executed on different processors. However, operations on a data item can be totally ordered. 

Does this situation cause any problem for the definition of conflict serializability?

No. The operations on the same data can't be executed on different processors due to the internal lock. Hence we can still establish the order of operations on the same data.
