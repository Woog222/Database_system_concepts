What is a cascadeless schedule? Why is cascadelessness of schedules desirable? Are there any circumstances under which it would be desirable to allow noncascadeless schedules?

---

A cascadeless schedule is a schedule such that the abort of any transactions does not incur chained abort actions of other transactions. It's usually related to the <b>dirty read</b>, which represents reading data updated by an uncommitted transaction.

It's surely desirable since the failure of a transaction does not cost much.

Under some circumstances where the failure rarely occurs, READ-ONLY transactions are prevailing, non cascadeless schedule might be accomdating since the cost for ensuring cascadeless can be spared and the concurrency increases.
