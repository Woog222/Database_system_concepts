### 17.2
Consider a file system such as the one on your favorite operating system.

---

#### a. What are the steps involved in the creation and deletion of files and in writing data to a file?

0. allocate the inode to the newly created file. 
1. follow the path and locate the directory inode
2. add  ```(file_name, inode)``` to the directory data Block.
3. if needed, allocate the datablocks and write the contents, and modify the inode to point to the allocated datablocks.




#### b. Explain how the issues of atomiity and durability are relevant to the reation and deletion of files and to writing data to files.

We need to maintain the consistency in the file system. Assume a standard Log-structured File system. 

Imagine a scenario we allocate a datablock to the file. The OS had just updated the inode to point to the datablock, and at the moment where the OS tried to modify data bitmap, system failed.

The inode is pointing to the datablock, which is not allocated at all according to the data bitmap in the block group.
