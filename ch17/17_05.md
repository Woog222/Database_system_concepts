Since every conflict-serializable schedule is view serializable, why do we emphasize conflict serializablity rather than view serializability?

---

The availability of the algorithm to test conflict serializability. We can construct the precedence graph and check whether there is a cycle, Where as testing the view serializability is well known to be NP-hard problem (as far as i know?)
