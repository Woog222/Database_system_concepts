### 17.8

The <b>lost update anomaly</b> is said to occur if a transaction $T
_j$ reads a data item, then another transaction $T_k$ writes the data item (possibly based on a previous read), after which $T_j$ writes the data item. The update performed by $T_k$ has been lost, since the update done by $T_j$ ignored the value written by $T_k$
