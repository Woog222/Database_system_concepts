### 18.4

Consider a database organized in the form of a rooted tree. Suppose that we
insert a dummy vertex between each pair of vertices. Show that, if we follow
the tree protocol on the new tree, we get better concurrency than if we follow
the tree protocol on the original tree.

The idea of <i>edge lock</i> provides a better concurrency since it prevents several <i>hold and wait</i> conditions to occur.

|   | $T_1$ | $T_2$ | $T_3$ |
|---|-------|-------|-------|
| A |       | LOCK  | wait  |
| B | LOCK  | wait  |       |

Suppose there is an edge $A \rightarrow B$. It's not until $B$ releases the lock that $T_2$ acquires the lock. It leads to poor concurrency since $T_3$ has to wait for $T_2$ to release the lock on $A$, whereas $T_2$ has to get the lock on $B$ first. However, with the help of the <i>edge lock</i> $A \rightarrow B$, $T_2$ can release the lock on $A$ once it finished the task on $A$ and acquired the edge lock. The edge lock indicates that <i>I've released the previous lock and now need to get the next Lock.</i> It will enhance the concurrency.
