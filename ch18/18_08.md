In timestamp ordering, ```W-timestamp(Q)``` denotes the largest timestamp of any
transaction that executed ```write(Q)``` successfully. Suppose that, instead, we defined it to be the timestamp of the most recent transaction to execute ```write(Q)```
successfully. Would this change in wording make any difference? Explain your
answer.

No difference.
```W(Q)``` can increase only.
