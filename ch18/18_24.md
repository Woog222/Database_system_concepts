### 18.24

The multiple-granularity protocol rules specify that a transaction Ti can lock a
node Q in S or IS mode only if Ti currently has the parent of Q locked in either IX or IS mode. Given that SIX and S locks are stronger than IX or IS locks, why does the protocol not allow locking a node in S or IS mode if the parent is locked in either SIX or S mode?
