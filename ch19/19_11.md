### 19.11

Sometimes a transaction has to be undone after it has committed because it
was erroneously executedâ€”for example, because of erroneous input by a bank
teller.

---


#### a. Give an example to show that using the normal transaction undo mechanism to undo such a transaction could lead to an inconsistent state.

100  
T1 -> +10 -> 110   
T2 -> +10 -> 120  

T1 rolled back -> 100   
T2 transactions lost

#### b. One way to handle this situation is to bring the whole database to a state prior to the commit of the erroneous transaction (called point-in-time recovery). Transactions that committed later have their effects rolled back with this scheme. Suggest a modification to the recovery algorithm of Section 19.4 to implement point-in-time recovery using database dumps.

start with the latest dump D before the $<start \ T_i>$.  
redo from D to $<T_i \ commit>$.
undo $T_i$ and all transactions which were active on $<T_i \ commit>$
