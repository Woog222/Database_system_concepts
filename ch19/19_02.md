### 19.2

Explain the purpose of the checkpoint mechanism. How often should check-
points be performed? How does the frequency of checkpoints affect:
+ System performance when no failure occurs?
+ The time it takes to recover from a system crash?
+ The time it takes to recover from a media (disk) failure?
