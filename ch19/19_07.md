### 19.7

Suppose we (incorrectly) modify the recovery algorithm of Section 19.4 to
note log actions taken during transaction rollback. When recovering from a
system crash, transactions that were rolled back earlier would then be included
in undo-list and rolled back again. Give an example to show how actions taken
during the undo phase of recovery could result in an incorrect database state.
(Hint: Consider a data item updated by an aborted transaction and then updated by a transaction that commits.)
