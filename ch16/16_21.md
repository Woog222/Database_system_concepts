Suppose two relations $r$ and $S$ have histograms on attributes $r.A$ and $s.A$, respectively, but with different ranges. Suggest how to use the histograms to estimate the size of $r \bowtie s$. Hint: Split the ranges of each histogram further.

Partition finer assuming uniform distribution within each range until we achieve equal range partitioning in the histogram.
