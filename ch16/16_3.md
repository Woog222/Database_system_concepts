### 16.3

For each of the following pairs of expressions, give instances of relations that
show the expressions are not equivalent.

Note : semijoin symbols are used instead of right outer join symbols)

#### a. $\Pi_A(r-s) \not\equiv \Pi_A(r) - \Pi_A(s) $

- $r$   

| A | B  |
|---|----|
| a | b1 |
| a | b2 |

- $s$

| A | B  |
|---|----|
| a | b1 |

#### b. $\sigma_{B<4}( _A\gamma_{max(B) \ as \ B}(r))  \not\equiv _A\gamma_{max(B) \ as \ B}(\sigma_{B<4}(r))$

| A | B |
|---|---|
| 1 | 3 |
| 1 | 5 |

#### c. In the preceding expressions, if both occurrences of max were replaced by min, would the expressions be equivalent?

Yes.


#### d. $(r \ltimes s) \ltimes t  \not\equiv r \ltimes (s \ltimes t)$


```
r(A,B) = {}
s(B,C) = (1,1)
t(A,C) = (1,1)

(1,n,1) != (1,1,1)
```

#### e. $\sigma_\theta(E_1 \rtimes E_2) \not\equiv E_1 \rtimes \sigma_\theta(E_2)$, $\theta$ uses only attributes from $E_2$.

Assume $\theta = C>2$
```
E1(A,B) = {(1,1)(2,2)}
E2(B,C) = {(2,2)(3,3)}

{} != {(1,1,n)}
```
