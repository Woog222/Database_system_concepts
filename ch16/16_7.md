Suppose that a B+-tree index on building is available on relation department
and that no other index is available. What would be the best way to handle the
following selections that involve negation?

---

#### a. $\sigma_{\neg (building < 'Watson')}(department)$

Perform the basic range search.

Assuming the index on <i>building</i> is a secondary index, careful consideration must be given to choosing between using the index for range search and employing brute force linear search option.

#### b. $\sigma_{\neg (building = 'Watson')}(department)$


Similar to the previous question, it seems more reasonable to opt for linear search in this case.

#### c. $\sigma_{\neg (building < 'Watson'\  \vee \ budget<50000)}(department)$


First, perform the query processing as we did in <b>a</b> and retrieve the tuples. While retrieving each tuple, we can check the latter condition and determine whether those tuples are to be added to the result.
