### 16.26

Consider a relation $r(A, B, C)$, with an index on attribute $A$. Give an example
of a query that can be answered by using the index only, without looking at the
tuples in the relation. (Query plans that use only the index, without accessing
the actual relation, are called <i>index-only</i> plans.)
