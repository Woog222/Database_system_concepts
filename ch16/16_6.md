### 16.6

Consider the relations $r_1(A, B, C)$, $r_2(C, D, E)$, and $r_3(E, F)$ of Practice Exercise 16.5. Assume that there are no primary keys, except the entire schema.
Let $V(C, r_1)$ be $900$, $V(C, r_2)$ be $1100$, $V(E, r_2)$ be $50$, and $V(E, r_3)$ be $100$.
Assume that $r_1$ has $1000$ tuples, $r_2$ has $1500$ tuples, and $r_3$ has $750$ tuples. Estimate the size of $r1 \bowtie r2 \bowtie r3$ and give an efficient strategy for computing the join.

$r_1 \bowtie r_2 = \frac{1000 \cdot 1500}{1100} \thickapprox 1364$<br>
$r_2 \bowtie r_3 = \frac{1500 \cdot 750}{100} = 11250$<br>
$r_1 \bowtie r_2 \bowtie r_3 \thickapprox 10227$

$r_1 \bowtie r_2$ first since it's smaller
