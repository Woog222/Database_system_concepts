Show that the following equivalences hold. Explain how you can apply them
to improve the efficiency of certain queries:

Proof omitted.

#### a. $E_1 \bowtie_\theta (E_2 - E_3) \equiv (E_1 \bowtie_\theta E_2 - E_1 \bowtie_\theta E_3)$.

The left one is better. 

#### b. $\sigma_\theta(_A \gamma_F(E)) \equiv _A\gamma_F(\sigma_\theta(E))$, where $\theta$ uses only attributes from $A$.

The right one is better.

#### c. $\sigma_\theta(E_1 \rtimes E_2) \equiv \sigma_\theta(E_1) \rtimes E_2$ where $\theta$ uses only attributes from $E_1$.

The right one is better.
