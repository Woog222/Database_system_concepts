Suppose that a B+-tree index on (dept name, building) is available on relation
department. What would be the best way to handle the following selection?

---

$\sigma_{(building < 'Watson') \wedge (budget < 55000) \wedge (dept\_name = 'Music')}(department)$


Perform the range query based on the condition ```(dept_name='Music', building < 'Watson')```.
Apply the remaining conjunctive condition when retrieving the tuples later.
