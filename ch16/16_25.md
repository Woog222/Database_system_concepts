Suppose you want to get answers to $r \bowtie s$ sorted on an attribute of $r$, and want only the top $K$ answers for some relatively small $K$. Give a good way of evaluating the query:

---
#### a. When the join is on a foreign key of r referencing s, where the foreign key attribute is declared to be not null.

For each $t_r \in r$, exactly one $t_s \in s$ will be matched when they are joined. First, sort $r$ by the order of the join attributes and determine the top K tuples of $r$. Then, join only those tuples.




#### b. When the join is not on a foreign key.

It's possible that each $t_r \in r$ can have multiple or no matching tuples in $s$.
Similarly, sort $r$. Starting with the 1st tuple of $r$, join with $s$ and add to the result one by one until we obtain K joined tuples.
