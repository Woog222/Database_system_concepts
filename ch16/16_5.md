Consider the relations $r_1(\underline{A}, B, C)$, $r_2(\underline{C}, D, E)$, and $r_3(\underline{E}, F)$, with primary keys
$A$, $C$, and $E$, respectively. Assume that $r_1$ has 1000 tuples, $r_2$ has 1500 tuples,
and $r_3$ has 750 tuples. Estimate the size of $r1 \bowtie r2 \bowtie r3$, and give an efficient
strategy for computing the join.

$r_1 \bowtie r_2 = 1000 $<br>
$r_2 \bowtie r_3 = 1500 $<br>
$r_1 \bowtie r_2 \bowtie r_3 = 1000$


Due to the primary key constraints of $C$ and $E$, the number of tuples in the result is restricted to the number of tuples in $r_1$.

Create indices on $C$ for $r_2$ and on $E$ for $r_3$. For each $t_{r_1} \in r_1$, find the matched tuples of $r_2$ and $r_3$, which exist at most once respectively.
