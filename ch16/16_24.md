### 16.24

Give an example of an expression defining a materialized view and two situations (sets of statistics for the input relations and the differentials) such that
incremental view maintenance is better than recomputation in one situation,
and recomputation is better in the other situation.

---

+ Incremental view maintenance is better
```SQL
-- For simplicity, Assume every department has at least one instructor.
CREATE VIEW num_inst(dept_name, num_instructor) as (
    SELECT dept_name, COUNT(*)
    FROM instructor
    GROUP BY dept_name
)
```

+ Recomputation is better
