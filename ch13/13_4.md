### 13.4
Consider the bitmap representation of the free-space map, where for each block in the file, two bits are maintained in the bitmap. If the block is between 0 and 30 percent full the bits are 00, between 30 and 60 percent the bits are 01, between 60 and 90 percent the bits are 10, and above 90 percent the bits are 11. Such bitmaps can be kept in memory even for quite large files.

#### a. Outline two benefits and one drawback to using two bits for a block, instead of one byte as described earlier in this chapter.

+ Rough estimate of available space: Higher search time and potential space wastage.
+ Efficient for storing bitmaps
+ Require less frequent updates


#### b. Describe how to keep the bitmap up to date on record insertions and deletions.

After every insertion or deletion, calculate the proportion of free space in the affected blocks and update the bitmap accordingly.

#### c. Outline the benefit of the bitmap technique over free lists in searching for free space and in updating free space information.

**Freelist**<br>
+ For large relations, it may be necessary to scan multiple entries before adequate free space.


**Bit map**<br>
+ Actual updates on the bitmap rarely occur, resulting in low maintenance overhead.
+ Since one page of the bitmap can store space information for many blocks, the I/O cost for finding free space is relatively low.
