### 13.4
Consider the bitmap representation of the free-space map, where for each block in the file, two bits are maintained in the bitmap. If the block is between 0 and 30 percent full the bits are 00, between 30 and 60 percent the bits are 01, between 60 and 90 percent the bits are 10, and above 90 percent the bits are 11. Such bitmaps can be kept in memory even for quite large files.

#### a. Outline two benefits and one drawback to using two bits for a block, instead of one byte as described earlier in this chapter.

+ only approximate idea of the free space available
    + increased search cost
    + wasted space 
+ space efficient for storing bitmap, less frequent update overhead

#### b. Describe how to keep the bitmap up to date on record insertions and deletions.

Upon every insertion and deletion, computes the fraction of free space in affected blocks, and updates the bitmap correspondingly.

#### c. Outline the benefit of the bitmap technique over free lists in searching for free space and in updating free space information.

Freelist<br>
+ for a big relation, multiple entries may have to be scanned before a sufficient free space is found. <br>


Bit map<br>
+ Actual updates on bitmap rarely occurs, hence requiring low overhead for maintenance
+ Since one page of bitmap can store space info for many blocks, I/O cost for finding free space is relatively low.
