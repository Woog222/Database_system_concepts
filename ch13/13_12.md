### 13.12

In the sequential file organization, why is an overflow block used even if there is, at the moment, only one overflow record?

---


1. To maintain its physical ordering as closely as possible.

If there's no space within the same block where the record logically belongs, inserting a record at the end of the relation can quickly disrupt the physical order.

2. Anticipating subsequent insertions that will fill the overflow block.
