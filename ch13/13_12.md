### 13.12

In the sequential file organization, why is an overflow block used even if there is, at the moment, only one overflow record?

---

1. To retain its physical ordering as much as possible. 

If we merely insert the new record at the end of the relation when there is no space in the same block at which the record logically right before the inserted one located, the physical ordering will be messed too quickly. 

2. Expecting Insertions following, which will fill in the overflow block.
