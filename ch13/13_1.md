### 13.1

Consider the deletion of record 5 from the file of Figure 13.3. Compare the relative merits of the following techniques for implementing the deletion:

#### a. Move record 6 to the space occupied by record 5, and move record 7 to the space occupied by record 6.

Since there's still a hole, It's utterly futile. That shifts were totally meaningless overhead. We need to maintain a freelist unless all the records following the deleted record 5 are shifted to ensure that all records are physically contiguous.

#### b. Move record 7 to the space occupied by record 5.

Similar with the above.

#### c. Mark record 5 as deleted, and move no records.

quite reasonable approach. We need to maintain a free list to track these <b>holes</b> and to reuse for later insertion. There is a tradeoff that the records is not contiguous anymore.
