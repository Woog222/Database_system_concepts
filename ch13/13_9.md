#### a. For variable-length fields, if the value is null, what would be stored in the offset and length fields?

(any, -1)

#### b. In some applications, tuples have a very large number of attributes, most of which are null. Can you modify the record representation such that the only overhead for a null attribute is the single bit in the null bitmap?

locate the null bitmap at the very front of the record. And do not allocate any space for attributes which is null. There is an overhead to extract attributes of the record
