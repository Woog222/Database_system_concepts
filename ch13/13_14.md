Standard buffer managers assume each block is of the same size and costs the
same to read. Consider a buffer manager that, instead of LRU, uses the rate
of reference to objects, that is, how often an object has been accessed in the
last n seconds. Suppose we want to store in the buffer objects of varying sizes,
and varying read costs (such as web pages, whose read cost depends on the
site from which they are fetched). Suggest how a buffer manager may choose
which block to evict from the buffer.
