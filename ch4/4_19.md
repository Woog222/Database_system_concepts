Under what circumstances would the query

```SQL
SELECT * 
FROM student NATURAL FULL OUTER JOIN takes 
   NATURAL FULL OUTER JOIN course
```
include tuples with null values for the title attribute?

-> There exists some students who have not taken any courses.<br>
-> There exists some students who have taken several courses not given by his/her department.<br>
-> the course relation internally has null values for the title attribute.<br>
