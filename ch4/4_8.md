### 4.8

As discussed in Section 4.4.8, we expect the constraint "an instructor cannot teach sections in two different classrooms in a semester in the same time slot" to hold.

---

#### a. Write an SQL query that returns all (instructor, section) combinations that violate this constraint.


```SQL
SELECT ID, semester, year, time_slot_id, 
    COUND(DISTINCT (building, room_number))
FROM section NATURAL JOIN teaches
GROUP BY ID, semester, year, time_slot_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT (building, room_number)) > 1
```

#### b. Write an SQL assertion to enforce this constraint (as discussed in Section 4.4.8, current generation database systems do not support assertions, although they are part of the SQL standard).


```SQL
CREATE ASSERTIONS CHECK NOT EXISTS(
    -- above query
)
```
