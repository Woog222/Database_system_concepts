### 4.1

Consider the following SQL query that seeks to find a list of titles of all courses taught in Spring 2017 along with the name of the instructor.

```SQL
SELECT name, title
FROM instructor NATURAL JOIN teaches NATURAL JOIN section NATURAL JOIN course
WHERE semester = 'Spring' AND year = 2017;
```

What is wrong with this query?

---

*dept_name* is included in both the course and instructor relations.

```SQL
-- modified version
SELECT name, title
FROM (instructor NATURAL JOIN teaches NATURAL JOIN section) AS T
    INNER JOIN course ON course.course_id = T.course_id
WHERE T.semester = 'Spring' AND T.year = 2017;
```
