Consider the query

```SQL
SELECT course_id,semester,year,sec_id,AVG(tot_cred)
FROM takes NATURAL JOIN student
WHERE year = 2017
GROUP BY course_id,semester,year,sec_id
HAVING COUNT(id) >= 2; 
```
Explain why appending NATURAL JOIN section in the FROM clause would not change the result.

-> does not use any attr in section in the above query
-> since the common attr between takes and section all satisfies foreign key referential integerity, the natural join just add some extra attr to the existing takes relation, without adding or truncating any tuples.
