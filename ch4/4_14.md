Consider the query

```SQL
SELECT course_id,semester,year,sec_id,AVG(tot_cred)
FROM takes NATURAL JOIN student
WHERE year = 2017
GROUP BY course_id,semester,year,sec_id
HAVING COUNT(id) >= 2; 
```
Explain why appending NATURAL JOIN section in the FROM clause would not change the result.

---

The above query does not use any attributes from the section table. 

Since the common attributes between takes and section all satisfy foreign key referential integrity, the natural join merely adds some extra attributes to the existing takes relation, without adding or removing any tuples.
