$r(A,B)$, $s(B,C)$, and $t(B,D)$, with all attributes declared as **not null**. 

a. Give instances of relations $r$,$s$, and $t$ such that in the result of 
```sql
(r NATURAL LEFT OUTER JOIN s) NATURAL LEFT OUTER JOIN t
```
attribute C has a null value but attribute D has a non-null value. 

(0,2) <br>
-<br>
(2,4) <br>
-> (0,2,n) -> (0,2,n,4)



b. Are there instances of $r$, $s$, and $t$ such that the result of 
```sql
r NATURAL LEFT OUTER JOIN (s NATURAL LEFT OUTER JOIN t)
```
has a null value for $C$ but a non-null value for $D$? Explain why or why not. 

A null value in C can only produced by the last left outer join, which is between (A,B) AND (B,C,D). Once a tuple with a null value in C is generated, D in that tuple must be null too.
