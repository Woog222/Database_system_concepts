Suppose we have three relations $r(A, B)$, $s(B, C)$, and $t(B, D)$, with all attributes
declared as **not null**.

---

#### a. Give instances of relations $r$,$s$, and $t$ such that in the result of the SQL query below attribute $C$ has a null value but attribute $D$ has a non-null value. 

```SQL
(r NATURAL LEFT OUTER JOIN s) NATURAL LEFT OUTER JOIN t
```

(0,2) <br>
-<br>
(2,4) <br>
-> (0,2,n) -> (0,2,n,4)



#### b. Are there instances of $r$, $s$, and $t$ such that the result of  of the SQL query below has a null value for $C$ but a non-null value for $D$? Explain why or why not. 

```sql
r NATURAL LEFT OUTER JOIN (s NATURAL LEFT OUTER JOIN t)
```
A null value in C can only be produced by the final left outer join, which occurs between *(A, B)* and *(B, C, D)*. Once a tuple with a null value in C is generated, D in that tuple must also be null.
