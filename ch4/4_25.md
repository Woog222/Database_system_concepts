Suppose a user creates a new relation $r_1$ with a foreign key referencing another relation $r_2$. What authorization privilege does the user need on r2? Why should this not simply be allowed without any such authorization?

Since it could hamper some modifications of $r_2$, creating a relation with a foreign key referencing $r_2$ should not be allowed without proper preceding authorization.
