Suppose a user creates a new relation $r_1$ with a foreign key referencing another relation $r_2$. What authorization privilege does the user need on r2? Why should this not simply be allowed without any such authorization?



the references previliege <br>
since it could hamper some modifications or $r_2$, it should not be allowed without proper authorization preceding.
