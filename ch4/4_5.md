<b>a. In Section 4.1.1 we saw an example of an erroneous SQL query which was intended to find which courses had been taught by each instructor; the query computed the natural join of instructor, teaches, and course, and as a result it unintentionally equated the dept_name attribute of instructor and course. Give an example of a dataset that would help catch this particular error.</b>

-> containing a course taught by an instructor from diffrent department with the course's one

<b>b. When creating test databases, it is important to create tuples in referenced relations that do not have any matching tuple in the referencing relation for each foreign key. Explain why, using an example query on the university database.</b>

-> to test several queries including outer join or fundamentally similar mechanics. For example, a query to list departments with the number of instructors in each department should include the departments to which no instructors belong, with each count 0 in the result. 
```SQL
SELECT ID, COUNT(sec_id) AS num_sec_taught -- COUNT(*) (X)
FROM instructor NATURAL LEFT OUTER JOIN teaches
GROUP BY ID
```
this query should include even instructors who have not taught any courses previously. For the purpose of completeness of testing, test database can include instructor tuples that do not have any matching tuples in teaches relation.


<b>c. When creating test databases, it is important to create tuples with null values for foreign-key attributes, provided the attribute is nullable (SQL allows foreign-key attributes to take on null values, as long as they are not part of the primary key and have not been declared as not null). Explain why, using an example query on the university database.
Hint: Use the queries from Exercise 4.2.</b>

```SQL
SELECT course_id, sec_id, 
    COALESCE(ID, '-') AS ID,
    COALESCE(name, '-') AS name
FROM section NATURAL LEFT OUTER JOIN teaches
    NATURAL JOIN instructor
WHERE semester = 'Spring' AND year = 2018
```
it's useful to insert null values into the foreign key of teaches relation to test this sort of queries. This kind of query often deals with some tricky demands, such as including

not null이어야 하는데 까먹고 안한 경우 발생할 수 있는 오류를 찾을 수 있어서? 모르겠다,,
