### 4.5
**Testing SQL queries**: To test if a query specified in English has beencorrectly written in SQL, the SQL query is typically executed on multiple test databases, and a human checks if the SQL query result on each test database matches the intention of the specification in English.

#### a. In Section 4.1.1 we saw an example of an erroneous SQL query which was intended to find which courses had been taught by each instructor; the query computed the natural join of instructor, teaches, and course, and as a result it unintentionally equated the dept_name attribute of instructor and course. Give an example of a dataset that would help catch this particular error.

Using a dataset containing a course taught by an instructor from a different department than the course's department would not produce the expected result.

#### b. When creating test databases, it is important to create tuples in referenced relations that do not have any matching tuple in the referencing relation for each foreign key. Explain why, using an example query on the university database.

To test several queries including outer joins or fundamentally similar mechanics, you might want to consider a query to list departments with the number of instructors in each department. This query should include departments with no instructors, showing a count of 0 for each.

For example:
```SQL
SELECT dept_name, COUNT(ID) AS num_instructors
FROM department LEFT OUTER JOIN instructor ON department.dept_name = instructor.dept_name
GROUP BY dept_name
```

For a query that lists the number of sections taught by each instructor, including those who have not taught any courses previously, you could use:
```SQL
SELECT ID, COUNT(sec_id) AS num_sec_taught
FROM instructor LEFT OUTER JOIN teaches ON instructor.ID = teaches.ID
GROUP BY instructor.ID
```

For completeness of testing, ensure the test database includes instructor tuples that do not have any matching tuples in the teaches relation.


#### c. When creating test databases, it is important to create tuples with null values for foreign-key attributes, provided the attribute is nullable (SQL allows foreign-key attributes to take on null values, as long as they are not part of the primary key and have not been declared as not null). Explain why, using an example query on the university database.
Hint: Use the queries from Exercise 4.2.

In real-world databases, it is common to encounter situations where not all relationships are fully populated. For example, a new instructor might be added to the database but hasn't yet been assigned to any courses.

When **dept_name** in the instructor table is nullable, some instructors might not belong to any department. This situation needs to be considered in queries that join the **instructor** table with the **department** table.


Suppose we wish to list the building of each instructor's department along with their ID using the following SQL query:
```SQL
select ID, COALESCE(building, '-') AS dept_building
from instructor NATURAL JOIN department
```
This query does not include instructors who do not have a department, as their department is set to null. This case must be handled properly. Therefore, the erroneous and incomplete query above needs to be tested and corrected.

In real-world databases, it is common to encounter situations where not all relationships are fully populated. For example, a new instructor might be added to the database but hasn't yet been assigned to any courses.
