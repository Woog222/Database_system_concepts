### 4.3

Outer join expressions can be computed in SQL without using the SQL outer join operation. To illustrate this fact, show how to rewrite each of the following SQL queries without using the outer join expression.

---
#### a.

```SQL
SELECT * FROM student NATURAL LEFT OUTER JOIN takes
```

```SQL
SELECT * FROM student NATURAL JOIN takes

UNION

SELECT ID, name, dept_name, tot_cred, 
    NULL AS course_id, 
    NULL AS sec_id,
    NULL AS semester,
    NULL AS year,
    NULL AS grade
FROM student 
WHERE student.ID NOT IN (
    SELECT ID
    FROM takes
)
```
#### b.
```SQL
SELECT * FROM student NATURAL FULL OUTER JOIN takes
```

```SQL
SELECT * FROM student NATURAL JOIN takes

UNION

SELECT ID, name, dept_name, tot_cred, 
    NULL AS course_id, 
    NULL AS sec_id,
    NULL AS semester,
    NULL AS year,
    NULL AS grade
FROM student 
WHERE student.ID NOT IN (SELECT IDFROM takes)

UNION

SELECT ID,
    NULL AS name,
    NULL AS dept_name,
    NULL AS tot_cred,
    course_id, sec_id, semester, year, grade
FROM takes
WHERE takes.ID NOT IN (SELECT ID FROM student)
```
