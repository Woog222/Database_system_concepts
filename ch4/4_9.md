<b>SQL allows a foreign-key dependecy to refer to the same relation, as in the following example:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE manager ( 
    employee_id char(20),
    manager_id char(20), 
    PRIMARY KEY employee_id,
    FOREIGN KEY (manager_id) REFERENCES manager (employee_id)
        ON DELETE CASCADE
); 
```
Here, employee_id is a key to the table manager, meaning that each employee has at at most one manager. The foreign-key clause requires that every manager also be an employee. Explain exactly what happens when a tuple in the relation manager is deleted.
</b>

-> subtrees having had the deleted employee as the root are to be deleted by the BFS order.
