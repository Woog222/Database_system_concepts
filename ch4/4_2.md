### 4.2

Write the following queries in SQL:

---

#### a. Display a list of all instructors, showing each instructor's ID and the number of sections taught. Make sure to show the number of sections as 0 for instuctors who have not taught any section. Your query should use an outer join, and should not use subqueries.

```SQL
SELECT ID, COUNT(sec_id) AS num_sec_taught -- COUNT(*) (X)
FROM instructor NATURAL LEFT OUTER JOIN teaches
GROUP BY ID
```

```SQL
SELECT ID, 0 AS num_sec_taught
FROM instructor
WHERE ID NOT IN ( SELECT ID FROM TEACHES)

UNION

SELECT ID, COUNT(*) AS num_sec_taught
FROM teaches
GROUP BY ID
```

#### b. Write the same query as in part a, but using a scalar subquery and not using outer join.
```SQL
SELECT ID,( SELECT COUNT(*) 
            FROM teaches 
            WHERE teaches.ID = instructor.ID
) AS num_sec_taught
FROM instructor
```
#### c. Display the list of all course sections offered in Spring 2018, along with the ID and name of each instructor teaching the section. If a section has more than one instructor, that section should appear as many times in the result as it has instructors. If a section does not have any instructor, it should still appear in the result with the instructor name set to "-".
```SQL
SELECT course_id, sec_id,
    CASE
        WHEN ID IS NULL THEN '-'
        ELSE ID
    END AS ID,
    CASE 
        WHEN ID IS NULL THEN '-'
        ELSE name
    END AS name
FROM section NATURAL LEFT OUTER JOIN teaches
    NATURAL JOIN instructor
WHERE semester = 'Spring' AND year = 2018
```

```SQL
SELECT course_id, sec_id, 
    COALESCE(ID, '-') AS ID,
    COALESCE(name, '-') AS name
FROM section NATURAL LEFT OUTER JOIN teaches
    NATURAL JOIN instructor
WHERE semester = 'Spring' AND year = 2018
```

```SQL
SELECT course_id, sec_id, ID, name
FROM section 
    NATURAL JOIN teaches 
    NATURAL JOIN instructor
WHERE semester = 'Spring' AND year = 2018

UNION

SELECT course_id, sec_id, '-' AS ID, '-' AS name
FROM section
WHERE year = 2018 AND semester = 'Spring'
    AND (course_id, sec_id) NOT IN (
        SELECT course_id, sec_id
        FROM teaches
        WHERE year = 2018 AND semester = 'Spring'
    )
```
#### d. Display the list of all departments, with the total number of instructors, in each department, without using subqueries. Make sure to show departments that have no instructors, and list those departments with an instructor count of zero.
```SQL
SELECT dept_name, COUNT(ID) AS num_instructors
FROM department NATURAL LEFT OUTER JOIN instructor
GROUP BY dept_name
```
