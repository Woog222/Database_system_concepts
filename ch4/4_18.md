For the database of Figure 4.12, write a query to find the ID of each employee with no manager. Note that an employee may simply have no manager listed or may have a null manager. Write your query using an outer join and then write it again using no outer join at all.

```SQL
-- using an outer join
SELECT employee.ID
FROM employee NATURAL LEFT OUTER JOIN manages
WHERE manager_id IS NULL
```

```SQL
-- using set operations
SELECT ID 
FROM employee

EXCEPT

SELECT ID
FROM manages
WHERE manager_id IS NOT NULL
```

```SQL
-- using not in operator
SELECT ID
FROM employee
WHERE ID NOT IN (
    SELECT ID
    FROM manages
    WHERE manager_id IS NOT NULL
)
```
