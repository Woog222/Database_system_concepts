<b>Show how to define the view student_grades(ID,GPA) giving the grade-point average of each student, based on the query in Exercise 3.2; recall that we use a relation grade_points(grade,points) to get the numeric points associated with a letter grade. Make sure your view definition correctly handles the case of null values for the grade attribute of the takes relation.</b>

```SQL
CREATE VIEW student_grades(ID, GPA) AS 
    SELECT ID, SUM(points * credits) / SUM(credits)
    FROM takes NATURAL JOIN course
        NATURAL LEFT OUTER JOIN grade_points
    WHERE grade IS NOT NULL
