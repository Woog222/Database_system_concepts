Suppose user A, who has all authorization privileges on a relation r, grants select on relation r to public with grant option. Suppose user B then grants select on r to A. Does this cause a cycle in the authorization graph? Explain why.

B->A does not imply anything, have to be ignored
hence no cycle is constructed..?
