We can convert any weak entity set to a strong entity set by simply adding ap-
propriate attributes. Why, then, do we have weak entity sets?

ANSWER WITH EXAMPLE (```section``` and ```course``` in the text)

1. add ```course_id``` to the ```section```
```
section {course_id, sec_id, semester, year}
```
-> redundancy. ```course_id``` appears both in ```sec_course``` relationship set and ```section``` entity set.

2. What if we delete ```sec_course``` relationship set then?    

-> We lose the explicit relationship between two entity sets. Obviously there's a connection between them.

3. What if we make ```sec_id``` uniquely identify each tuples in section?

-> This is a feasible solution, still giving away the real world relationship between them though.
