### 6.18

Consider two entity sets $A$ and $B$ that both have the attribute $X$ (among
others whose names are not relevant to this question).

---

#### a. If the two $X$ s are completely unrelated, how should the design be improved?

rename distinctly

#### b. If the two $X$ s represent the same property and it is one that applies both to $A$ and to $B$, how should the design be improved? Consider three subcases: 

* $X$ is the primary key for $A$ but not $B$<br>
    -> foreign key from B to A

* $X$ is the primary key for both $A$ and $B$ <br>
    -> merge
* $X$ is not the primary key for $A$ nor for $B$ <br>
    -> do nothing OR,,

to set the explicit relationship, generate a new entity set having $X$ as <i>primary key</i>. Then let $X$ in $A$ and $B$ be a <i>foreign key</i> referencing the new set.
