### 6.11

In SQL, foreign key constraints can reference only the primary key attributes of the referenced relation or other attributes declared to be a superkey using the <b>unique</b> constraint. As a result, total participation constraints on a many-to-many relationship set (or on the "one" side of a one-to-many relationship set) cannot be enforced on the relations created from the relationship set, using primary key, foreign key, and not null constraints on the relations.

---

#### a. Explain why.

To enforce the total participation of A using ```foreign_key``` and ```not null``` constraints, 

```SQL
CREATE TABLE A (
    -- OMIT NON-KEY ATTRIBUTES
    TYPE A_1 NOT NULL,
    .. 
    TYPE A_n NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(A_1, .. A_n),
    FOREIGN KEY(A_1, .. A_n) REFERENCES ON R
)
```

this is impossible since ```(A_1, .. A_n)``` is not a super key of ```R```

For the same reason, In many-to-one case, We cannot enforce total participation on the "one" side sets.

#### b. Explain how to enforce total participation constaints using complex check constraints or assertions (see Section 4.4.8). (Unfortunately, these features are not supported on any widely used database currently.)

```SQL
CREATE ASSERTION eforce_total
CHECK NOT EXISTS(
    SELECT *
    FROM A
    WHERE A.Akeys NOT IN (
        SELECT Akeys
        FROM R
    )
    -- for B is analogous
)
```

A -> B (many to one)
```SQL
CONSTRAINT total_part CHECK (b IN (SELECT b FROM A));
SET CONSTRAINTS total_part DEFERRED;
```

why deferred? What if we insert a new value to B first before A?
