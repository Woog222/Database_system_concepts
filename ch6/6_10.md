### 6.10

Consider a many-to-one relationship $R$ between entity sets $A$ and $B$. 
Suppose the relation created from $R$ is combined with the relation created
from $A$. In SQL, attributes participating in a foreign key constraint can be null. 
Explain how a constraint on total participation of $A$ in $R$ can be enforced using 
**NOT NULL** constriant in SQL.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE A (
    -- omit A's attrs
    -- 
    TYPE B1 NOT NULL,
    -- ...
    TYPE Bn NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY(B1, .. Bn) REFERENCES ON B


)

```
