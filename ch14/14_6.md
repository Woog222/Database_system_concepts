### 14.6

Give pseudocode for a B+-tree function ```findRangeIterator()```, which is like the
function ```findRange()```, except that it returns an iterator object, as described
in Section 14.3.2. Also give pseudocode for the iterator class, including the
variables in the iterator object, and the ```next()``` method.
