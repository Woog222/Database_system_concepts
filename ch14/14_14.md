Suppose you have a relation containing the $x, y$
 coordinates and names of restaurants. Suppose also that the only queries that will be asked are of the following form: The query specifies a point and asks if there is a restaurant exactly at that point. Which type of index would be preferable, R-tree or B-tree? Why?

 ---

B+-Tree remains applicable since this is not an approximate query. We're searching for a restaurant that matches the coordinates exactly.
