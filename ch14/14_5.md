Consider the modified redistribution scheme for B+-trees described on page 651. What is the expected height of the tree as a function of n?

---

Assuming $m-1$ siblings are involved in redistribution and the order is $n$, the minimum number of keys in a node is approximately $\frac{m-1}{m}\times n$.

Therefore, the expected height of the tree is represented as $O(\log_{\lfloor\frac{(m-1)n}{m}\rfloor}(K))$, where $K$ denotes the number of keys in a B+-Tree.
