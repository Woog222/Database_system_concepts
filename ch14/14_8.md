Suppose you have a relation $r$ with $n_r$ tuples on which a secondary B+-tree is
to be constructed.

---

#### a. Give a formula for the cost of building the B+-tree index by inserting one record at a time. Assume each block will hold an average of f entries and that all levels of the tree above the leaf are in memory.


Given that both ```READ``` and ```WRITE``` are necessary for each tuple, it requires $2n_r$ disk accesses.

Additionally, considering that at most $O(\frac{n_r}{f})$ splits can occur, an additional $\frac{n_r}{f}$ page writes are added.

#### b. Assuming a random disk access takes 10 milliseconds, what is the cost of index construction on a relation with 10 million records?

#### c. Write pseudocode for bottom-up construction of a B+-tree, which was outlined in Section 14.4.4. You can assume that a function to efficiently sort a large file is available.
