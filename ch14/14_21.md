Suppose you have to create a B+-tree index on a large number of names, where the maximum size of a name may be quite large (say 40 characters) and the average name is itself large (say 10 characters). Explain how prefix compression can be used to maximize the average fanout of nonleaf nodes.

Apply the prefix compression so that search keys have enough information to distinguish among them. Doing so decreases the size of keys and increases the fanout of the nodes.
