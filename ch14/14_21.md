Suppose you have to create a B+-tree index on a large number of names, where the maximum size of a name may be quite large (say 40 characters) and the average name is itself large (say 10 characters). Explain how prefix compression can be used to maximize the average fanout of nonleaf nodes.

Implement prefix compression to ensure that search keys contain sufficient information to differentiate between them. This compression reduces the size of keys and enhances the fanout of the nodes.
