Suppose a relation is stored in a B+-tree file organization. Suppose secondary indices store record identifiers that are pointers to records on disk.

---
#### a. What would be the effect on the secondary indices if a node split happened in the file organization?

For records whose position is moved, their corresponding secondary indices have to be modified. 

#### b. What would be the cost of updating all affected records in a secondary index?

Since the records might not be in physically contiguous by the order of the index, it would require lots of Block I/O, which is proportional to the number of records that are to be updated.

#### c. How does using the search key of the file organization as a logical record identifier solve this problem?

We can store the Primary Key (the search key of the file organization) on the secondary index entry, replacing the pointer to the actual records. We don't have to update indices unless there are modifications on the actual records.

#### d. What is the extra cost due to the use of such logical record identifiers?

When we try to access the actual record via the secondary index, we need one more extra indirection to get the record.
