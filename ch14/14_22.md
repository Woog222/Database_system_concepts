Suppose a relation is stored in a B+-tree file organization. Suppose secondary indices store record identifiers that are pointers to records on disk.

---
#### a. What would be the effect on the secondary indices if a node split happened in the file organization?

Whenever records are relocated, their associated secondary indices must be adjusted accordingly.


#### b. What would be the cost of updating all affected records in a secondary index?


Considering that records may not be physically contiguous according to the index order, a substantial amount of Block I/O becomes necessary. This demand scales with both the number of records scheduled for update and the height of the B+-tree.

#### c. How does using the search key of the file organization as a logical record identifier solve this problem?

We can store the Primary Key (which serves as the search key of the file organization) on the secondary index entry, replacing the pointer to the actual records. This means we only need to update indices when there are modifications made to the actual records.

#### d. What is the extra cost due to the use of such logical record identifiers?


When accessing the actual record via the secondary index, an additional indirection step is required to retrieve the record.
