### 3.7

Consider the SQL query
```SQL
select p.a1
from p, r1, r2
where p.a1 = r1.a1 or p.a1 = r2.a1
```
Under what conditions does the preceding query select values of p.a1 that are
either in r1 or in r2? Examine carefully the cases where either r1 or r2 may be
empty.

--- 


When neither $r_1$ nor $r_2$ is empty. if one of them is empty, the result will be empty regardless of whether there are matching tuples in either $r_1$ or $r_2$â€‹, since the Cartesian product with an empty relation is always empty
