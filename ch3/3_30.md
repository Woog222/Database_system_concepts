### 3.30
Consider the following SQL query on the university schema: 

```sql
SELECT AVG(salary) - (SUM(salary)/COUNT(*))
FROM instructor
```
We might expect that the result of this query is zero since the average of a set of numbers is defined to be the sum of the numbers divided by the number of numbers. Indeed this is true for the example  *instructor* relation in Figure 2.1. However, there are other possible instances of that relation for which the result would *not* be zero. Give one suchinstance, and explain why the result would not be zero.

Among aggregate functions, only COUNT(*) includes NULL values in its calculation.
