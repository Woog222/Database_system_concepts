a. Find the total grade points earned by the student with ID '12345', across all courses taken by the student.

```SQL
SELECT SUM(points * credits) AS total_grade_points
FROM takes AS T
    INNER JOIN course AS C ON T.course_id = C.course_id
    INNER JOIN grade_points AS G ON T.grade = G.grade
WHERE T.ID = '12345'

UNION

SELECT 0
FROM student
WHERE ID = '12345' AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT *
    FROM takes
    WHERE takes.ID = '13245'
)
```

b. Find the grade point average (GPA) for the above student, that is, the total grade points divided by the total credits for the associated courses.

```SQL
SELECT SUM(points * credits) / SUM(credits) AS gpa
FROM takes AS T
    INNER JOIN course AS C ON T.course_id = C.course_id
    INNER JOIN grade_points AS G ON T.grade = G.grade
WHERE T.ID = '12345'
-- need some modification for students who have not taken any courses
```
c. Find the ID and the grade-point average of each student.

```SQL
SELECT T.ID, SUM(points * credits) / SUM(credits) AS gpa
FROM takes AS T
    INNER JOIN course AS C ON T.course_id = C.course_id
    INNER JOIN grade_points AS G ON T.grade = G.grade
GROUP BY T.ID
```
d. Now reconsider your answers to the earlier parts of this exercise under the assumption that some grades might be null. Explain whether your solutions still work and, if not, provide versions that handle nulls properly.
