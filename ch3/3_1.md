### 3.1

a.    
```SQL
SELECT title
FROM course
WHERE dept_name = 'Comp. Sci.' AND credits = 3
```

b. 
```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT takes.ID
FROM takes, teaches, instructor
WHERE takes.course_id = teaches.course_id 
    AND takes.sec_id = teaches.sec_id 
    AND takes.semester = teaches.semester
    AND takes.year = teaches.year 
    AND teaches.ID = instructor.ID
    AND instructor.name = 'Einstein'
```

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT ID
FROM takes
WHERE (course_id, sec_id, semester, year) in (
    SELECT course_id, sec_id, semester, year
    FROM teaches, instructor
    WHERE teaches.ID = instructor.ID AND instructor.name = 'Einstein'
)
```

c.
```SQL
SELECT MAX(salary)
FROM instructor
```

+ SQLite(X)
```SQL
SELECT salary
FROM instructor
WHERE NOT (salary < some (SELECT salary FROM instructor)) 
```

d.

+ not available on SQLite 
```SQL
SELECT *
FROM instructor
WHERE salary > ALL (SELECT salary FROM instructor)
```

+ fine
```SQL
SELECT * 
FROM instructor
WHERE salary = (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM instructor)
```

e.

+ assuming at least one student took for each section
```SQL
SELECT course_id, sec_id, COUNT(*) AS enrollment
FROM takes NATURAL JOIN section
WHERE semester = 'Fall' AND year = 2017
GROUP BY course_id, sec_id
```
   
+ robust version   
```SQL
SELECT course_id, sec_id, (
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM takes as T
    WHERE T.course_id = S.course_id 
        AND T.sec_id = S.sec_id
        AND T.year = S.year
        AND T.semester = S.semester 
) AS enrollment
FROM section as S
WHERE year = 2017 AND semester = 'Fall'
```

+ incomplete version (guess the reason)
```SQL
SELECT course_id, sec_id, COUNT(ID) AS enrollment
FROM takes
WHERE year=2017 AND semester = 'Fall'
GROUP BY course_id, sec_id
``` 

+ now complete (robust version 2)   
```SQL
SELECT S.course_id as course, S.sec_id as section, COUNT(ID) AS enrollment
FROM section AS S LEFT OUTER JOIN takes AS T
    ON S.course_id = T.course_id 
    AND S.sec_id = T.sec_id
    AND S.year = T.year
    AND S.semester = T.semester
WHERE S.semester = 'Fall' AND S.year = 2017
GROUP BY S.course_id, S.sec_id
```
f. Find the maxium enrollment, across all sections, in Fall 2017.
```SQL
WITH TEMP(course_id, sec_id, enrollment) AS (
    SELECT course_id, sec_id, (
        SELECT COUNT(*)
        FROM takes as T
        WHERE T.course_id = S.course_id 
            AND T.sec_id = S.sec_id
            AND T.year = S.year
            AND T.semester = S.semester 
    ) AS enrollment
    FROM section as S
    WHERE year = 2017 AND semester = 'Fall'
)

SELECT CASE
            WHEN MAX(enrollment) IS NOT NULL THEN MAX(enrollment)
            ELSE 0
        END AS max_enrollment
FROM TEMP
```
 

g. Find the sections that had the maximum enrollment in Fall 2017.
```SQL
WITH TEMP(course_id, sec_id, enrollment) AS (
    SELECT course_id, sec_id, (
        SELECT COUNT(*)
        FROM takes as T
        WHERE T.course_id = S.course_id 
            AND T.sec_id = S.sec_id
            AND T.year = S.year
            AND T.semester = S.semester 
    ) AS enrollment
    FROM section as S
    WHERE year = 2017 AND semester = 'Fall'
)

SELECT course_id, sec_id, enrollment 
FROM TEMP
WHERE enrollment = (
        SELECT CASE
            WHEN MAX(enrollment) IS NOT NULL THEN MAX(enrollment)
            ELSE 0
        END AS max_enrollment
        FROM TEMP
    )
```
