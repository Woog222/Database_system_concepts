    WHERE report_number IN (
        SELECT report_number
        FROM accident
        WHERE year = 2017
    )
)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT driver_id) AS CNT
FROM owns
WHERE licens_plate IN CAR_2017
```

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT driver_id) AS CNT
FROM owns AS O
    INNER JOIN participated AS P ON O.license_plate = P.licens_plate
    INNER JOIN accident AS A ON P.report_number = A.report_number
WHERE A.year = 2017

```
b. Delete all year-2010 cars belonging to the person whose ID is '12345'.
