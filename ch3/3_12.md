### 3.12

Write the SQL statements using the university schema to perform the following
operations:

---


#### a. Create a new course "CS-001", titled "Weekly Seminar", with 0 credits.
```SQL
INSERT INTO course (course_id, title, dept_name, credits)
VALUES ('CS-001', 'Weekly Seminar', 'Comp. Sci.', 0)
```
#### b. Create a section of this course in Fall 2017, with sec_id of 1, and with the location of this section not yet specified.
```SQL
INSERT INTO section (course_id, sec_id, semester, year, building, room_number, time_slot_id)
values('CS-001', '1', 'Fall', 2017, NULL, NULL, NULL)
```

#### c. Enroll every student in the Comp. Sci. department in the above section.
```SQL
INSERT INTO takes (ID, course_id, sec_id, semester, year, grade)
(
    SELECT ID, 'CS-001', '1', 'Fall', 2017, NULL
    FROM student
    WHERE dept_name = 'Comp. Sci.
)
```
#### d. Delete enrollments in the above section where the student's ID is 12345.
```SQL
DELETE FROM takes
WHERE ID ='12345' 
    AND course_id = 'CS-001'
    AND sec_id = '1'
    AND semester = 'Fall'
    AND year = 2017
```

#### e. Delete the course CS-001. What will happen if you run this delete statement without first deleting offerings (sections) of this course?
```SQL
DELETE FROM course
WHERE course_id = 'CS-001'
-- not allowed
-- ON DELETE CASCADE option can be useful
```
#### f. Delete all takes tuples corresponding to any section of any course with the word "advanced" as a part of the title; ignore case when matching the word with the title.
```SQL
DELETE FROM takes
WHERE course_id IN (
    SELECT course_id
    FROM course
    WHERE LOWER(tile) LIKE '%advanced%'
)
```
