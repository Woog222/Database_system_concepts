### 3.22
Rewrite the where clause

```SQL
where unique (select title from course)
```
without using the unique construct.

---

```SQL
WHERE 1 >= ALL (
    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM course 
    GROUP BY title
    )

-- using primary key
WHERE NOT EXISTS(
    SELECT *
    FROM course AS A, course AS B
    WHERE A.title = B.title 
        AND A.course_id <> B.course_id
)

-- the most general one
WHERE NOT EXSITS (
    (SELECT title FROM course)
    EXCEPT ALL
    (SELECT DISTINCT title FROM course)
)
```
