Using the university schema, write an SQL query to find the names and IDs of those instructors who teach every course taught in his or her department (i.e., every course that appears in the *course* relation with the instructor's department name). Order result by name.

```SQL
SELECT I.ID, I.name
FROM instructor AS I
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    -- every course taught in a instructor's dept
    ( 
        SELECT C.course_id
        FROM course AS C
        WHERE C.dept_name = I.dept_name
    )
    EXCEPT
    -- every course a instuctor taught 
    (
        SELECT T.course_id
        FROM teaches AS T
        WHERE T.ID = I.ID
    )
)
ORDER BY name ASC;
