Using the university schema, write an SQL query to find the names and IDs of those instructors who teach every course taught in his or her department (i.e., every course that appears in the course relation with the instructor's department name). Order result by name.

```SQL
SELECT I.ID, I.name
FROM instructor AS I
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    -- every course taught in a instructor's dept
    ( 
        SELECT course.course_id
        FROM course
        WHERE course.dept_name = I.dept_name
    )
    EXCEPT
    -- every course a instuctor taught 
    (
        SELECT teaches.course_id
        FROM teaches
        WHERE teaches.ID = I.ID
    )
)
ORDER BY name ASC;
```
