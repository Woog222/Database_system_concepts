Using the university schema, write an SQL query to find the name and ID of those Accounting students advised by an instructor in the Physics department.

```SQL
SELECT ID, name
FROM student INNER JOIN advisor ON student.ID = advisor.s_id
WHERE dept_name = 'Accounting' 
    AND i_id IN (
        SELECT instructor.ID
        FROM instructor
        WHERE dept_name = 'Physics'
    )
```
