Using the university schema, write an SQL query to find the name and ID of each History student whose name begins with the letter 'D' and who has not taken at least five Music courses.

```SQL
WITH music_courses(course_id) AS (
    SELECT course_id
    FROM course
    WHERE dept_name = 'Music'
)
SELECT ID, name
FROM student
WHERE dept_name = 'History'
    AND name LIKE 'D%'
    5 > (
        SELECT COUNT(*)
        FROM takes
        WHERE takes.ID = student.ID
            AND takes.course_id IN (
                SELECT course_id
                FROM music_courses
            )
    )

```
