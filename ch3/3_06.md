### 3.6
The SQL **LIKE** operator is case sensitive (in most systems), but the **lower()** functionon strings can be used to perform case-insensitive matching. To show how, write a query that finds departments whose names contain the string "sci" as a substring, regardlessof the case.

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM department
WHERE LOWER(dept_name) LIKE '%sci%'

```
