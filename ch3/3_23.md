Consider the query:
```SQL
WITH dept_total(dept_name, value) AS (
    SELECT dept_name, SUM(salary)
    FROM instructor
    GROUP BY dept_name
), dept_total_avg(value) AS (
    SELECT AVG(value)
    FROM dept_total
)
SELECT dept_name
FROM dept_total, dept_total_avg
WHERE dept_total.value >= dept_total_avg.value
```

Rewrite this query without using the **with** construct.

```SQL
SELECT D
FROM (
    SELECT dept_name, SUM(salary)
    FROM instructor
    GROUP BY dept_name
) AS A(D,S)
WHERE S >= (
    SELECT AVG(S)
    FROM A
)
```
