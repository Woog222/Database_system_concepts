Rewrite the preceding query, but also ensure that you include only instructors who have given at least one other non-null grade in some course.

```SQL
with temp(s_id, i_id, grade) AS (
    SELECT takes.ID, teaches.ID, takes.grade
    FROM takes INNER JOIN teaches
        ON (takes.course_id, takes.sec_id, takes.semester, takes.year) = (teaches.course_id, teaches.sec_id, teaches.semester, teaches.year)
)
SELECT ID, name
FROM instructor
WHERE ID NOT IN (
    SELECT i_id
    FROM temp
    WHERE grade = 'A'
) AND ID IN (
    SELECT i_id
    FROM temp
    WHERE grade IS NOT NULL
)
