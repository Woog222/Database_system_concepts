Using the university schema, write an SQL query to find the names of those departments whose budget is higher than that of Philosophy. List them in alphabetic order.

```SQL
SELECT dept_name
FROM department as D1
WHERE D1.budget > (
    SELECT D2.budget
    FROM department as D2
    WHERE D2.dept_name = 'Philosophy'
)
ORDER BY dept_name ASC
```
