Using the university schema, write an SQL query to find section(s) with maximum enrollment. The result columns should appear in the order "courseid, secid, year, semester, num". (It may be convenient to use the with construct.)

---
```SQL
WITH section_enrollment(course_id, sec_id, year, semester, num) AS (
    SELECT course_id, sec_id, year, semester, COUNT(ID) as num
    FROM takes
    GROUP BY course_id, sec_id, year, semester
)
SELECT course_id, sec_id, year, semester, num
FROM section_enrollment
WHERE num = (SELECT MAX(T.num) FROM section_enrollment AS T)
```
