a. Find the ID and name of each student who has taken at least one Comp. Sci. course; make sure there are no duplicates names in the result.
```SQL
-- parentheses may not be allowed in SQLite
-- try "SELECT DISTINCT ID, name" instead
SELECT DISTINCT (ID, name) 
FROM takes NATURAL JOIN student
WHERE course_id IN (
    SELECT course_id
    FROM course
    WHERE dept_name = 'Comp. Sci.'
)
```
b. Find the ID and name of each student who has not taken any course offered before 2017.
```SQL
SELECT ID, name
FROM student
WHERE ID NOT IN (
    SELECT ID
    FROM takes
    WHERE year < 2017
)
```
c. For each department, find the maximum salary of instructors in that department. You may assume that every department has at least one instructor.
```SQL
SELECT dept_name, MAX(salary)
FROM department NATURAL JOIN instructor
GROUP BY dept_name
```
d. Find the lowest, across all departments, of the per-department maximum salary computed by the preceding query.
```SQL
WITH dept_max_salary(dept_name, max_salary) AS (
    SELECT dept_name, MAX(salary) AS max_salary
    FROM department NATURAL JOIN instructor
    GROUP BY dept_name
)
SELECT MIN(max_salary)
FROM dept_max_salary
```
