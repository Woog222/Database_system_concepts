### 3.2

Suppose you are given a relation _grade_points(<u>grade</u>, points)_ that providesa conversion from letter grades in the _takes_ relation to numeric scores; for example, an "A" grade could be specified to correspond to 4 points, an "A-" to 3.7 points, a "B+" to 3.3 points, a "B" to 3 points and so on. The grade points earned by a student for a course offering (section) is defined as the number of credits for the course multiplied by the numeric points for the grade that the student received. Given the preceding relation and our university schema, write each of the following queries in SQL. You may assume for simplicity that no _takes_ tuple has the _null_value for _grade_. <br>

---

#### a. Find the total grade points earned by the student with ID '12345', across all courses taken by the student.

```SQL
SELECT SUM(points * credits) AS total_grade_points
FROM takes AS T
    INNER JOIN course AS C ON T.course_id = C.course_id
    INNER JOIN grade_points AS G ON T.grade = G.grade
WHERE T.ID = '12345'

UNION

SELECT 0
FROM student
WHERE ID = '12345' AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT *
    FROM takes
    WHERE takes.ID = '13245'
)
```

#### b. Find the grade point average (GPA) for the above student, that is, the total grade points divided by the total credits for the associated courses.

```SQL
SELECT SUM(points * credits) / SUM(credits) AS gpa
FROM takes AS T
    INNER JOIN course AS C ON T.course_id = C.course_id
    INNER JOIN grade_points AS G ON T.grade = G.grade
WHERE T.ID = '12345'
-- proper modification for students who have not taken any courses is needed
```
#### c. Find the ID and the grade-point average of each student.

```SQL
SELECT T.ID, SUM(points * credits) / SUM(credits) AS gpa
FROM takes AS T
    INNER JOIN course AS C ON T.course_id = C.course_id
    INNER JOIN grade_points AS G ON T.grade = G.grade
GROUP BY T.ID
```
#### d. Now reconsider your answers to the earlier parts of this exercise under the assumption that some grades might be null. Explain whether your solutions still work and, if not, provide versions that handle nulls properly.
