### 3.5
Suppose that we have a relation _marks(ID,score)_ and we wish to assign gradesto students based on the score as follows: grade _F_ if _score_ $<$ 40, grade _C_if 40 $\leq$ _score_ $<$ 60, grade _B_ if 60 $\leq$ _score_ $<$ 80, and grade _A_if 80 $\leq$ _score_. Write SQL queries to do the following: 

---

#### a. Display the grade for each student, based on the marks relation.

```SQL
SELECT ID, 
    CASE
        WHEN score < 40 THEN 'F' 
        WHEN score < 60 THEN 'C'
        WHEN score < 80 THEN 'B'
        ELSE 'A'
    END
FROM marks
```
#### b. Find the number of students with each grade.

```SQL
WITH temp(ID, grade) AS (
    SELECT ID, 
        CASE
            WHEN score < 40 THEN 'F' 
            WHEN score < 60 THEN 'C'
            WHEN score < 80 THEN 'B'
            ELSE 'A'
        END
    FROM marks
)
SELECT grade, COUNT(ID) AS num_std
FROM temp
GROUP BY grade
```
