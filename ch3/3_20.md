### 3.20

Show that, in SQL, <> all is identical to not in.

---

```SQL
-- Q1
SELECT A1, .. An
FROM S
WHERE (B1, .. Bm) NOT IN (
    -- subquery
)

-- Q2
SELECT A1, .. An
FROM S
WHERE (B1, .. Bm) <> ALL (
    -- subquery
)
```

It is easy to verify that both queries are equivalent.

For the proof sketch, we need to show the following two propositions.

Let $r_1$, $r_2$ be the results of each query, respectively.

1. $\forall t_1 \in r_1, t_1 \in r_2$
2. $\forall t_2 \in r_2, t_2 \in r_1$
