Using the university schema, write an SQL query to find the ID and title of each course in Comp. Sci. that has had at least one section with afternoon hours (i.e., ends at or after 12:00). (You should eliminate duplicates if any.)

```SQL
SELECT course_id, title
FROM course
WHERE dept_name = 'Comp. Sci.' 
    AND course_id IN (
        SELECT course_id
        FROM section NATURAL JOIN time_slot
        WHERE end_time >= 12:00
    )
```
