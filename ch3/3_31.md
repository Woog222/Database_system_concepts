### 3.31

Using the university schema, write an SQL query to find the ID and name of each instructor who has never given an A grade in any course she or he has taught. (Instructors who have never taught a course trivially satisfy this condition.)

```SQL
with A_sections(course_id, sec_id, semester, year) AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT (course_id, sec_id, semester, year)
    FROM takes
    WHERE grade = 'A'
)
SELECT ID, name
FROM instructor
WHERE ID NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT ID
    FROM teaches
    WHERE (course_id, sec_id ,semester, year) IN A_sections
)
```
