Using the university schema, write an SQL query to find the ID and name of each instructor who has never given an A grade in any course she or he has taught. (Instructors who have never taught a course trivially satisfy this condition.)

```SQL
with temp(s_id, i_id, grade) AS (
    SELECT takes.ID, teaches.ID, takes.grade
    FROM takes INNER JOIN teaches
        ON (takes.course_id, takes.sec_id, takes.semester, takes.year) = (teaches.course_id, teaches.sec_id, teaches.semester, teaches.year)
)
SELECT ID, name
FROM instructor
WHERE ID NOT IN (
    SELECT i_id
    FROM temp
    WHERE grade = 'A'
)
```
