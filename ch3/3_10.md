### 3.10

Consider the relational database of Figure 3.19. Give an expression in SQL for
each of the following:

---

#### a. Modify the database so that the employee whose ID is '12345' now lives in "Newtown".

```SQL
UPDATE employee
SET city = 'Newtown'
WHERE ID = '12345'
```
#### b. Give each manager of "First Bank Corporation" a 10 percent raise unless the salary becomes greater than $100000; in such cases, give only a 3 percent raise.
```SQL
UPDATE works
SET salary = salary * 1.03
WHERE salary * 1.1 > 100000 
    AND company_name = 'First Bank Corporation'
    AND ID IN (SELECT manager_id FROM manages)

UPDATE works
SET salary = salary * 1.1
WHERE salary * 1.1 <= 100000
    AND company_name = 'First Bank Corporation'
    AND ID IN (SELECT manager_id FROM manages)
```
