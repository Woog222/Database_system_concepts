### 7.10
Our discussion of lossless decomposition implicitly assumed that attributes on the left-hand side of a functional dependency cannot take on null values. What could go wrong on decomposition, if this property is violated?

---

$$ 
\Pi_{R_1}(r) \bowtie \Pi_{R_2}(r) = r
$$

left hand side is used as a natural join operator.


R = (A,B,C), A->B <br><br>
(a,b,c)
(null,x,y) <br><br>
after decomposed <br><br>
(a,b)(null,x) && (a,c) (null,y) <br><Br>
when joined <br><br>
(a,b,c) only

<b>null value is unknown when used in where predicates!</b>
