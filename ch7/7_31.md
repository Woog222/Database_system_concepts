### 7.31 

Consider the schema $R = (A,B,C,D,E,G)$ and the set $F$ of functional dependencies: 
$$
AB \rightarrow CD  \\
B \rightarrow D  \\
DE \rightarrow B \\
DEG \rightarrow AB \\
AC \rightarrow DE  \\
$$

$R$ is not in BCNF for many reasons, one of which arises from the functional 
dependency $AB \rightarrow CD$. Explain why $AB \rightarrow CD$ shows that 
$R$ is not in BCNF and then use the BCNF decomposition algorithm starting with 
$AB \rightarrow CD$ to generate a BCNF decomposition of $R$. Once that is done, 
determine whether your result is or is not dependency preserving, and explain 
your reasoning.

1. BCNF Decomposition
``` python
AB+ = {A,B,C,D,E}
# not a super key
```

``` Python
# AB->CDE
(A,B,C,D) (A,B,E,G)

# B->D, it's done
(B,D) (A,B,C) (A,B,E,G)# R1, R2, R3
```

2. 
```
F1 = {

    
}
```
