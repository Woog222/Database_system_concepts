### 7.21
Give a lossless, dependency-preserving decomposition into 3NF of schema of Exercise 7.1.

---

1. $F_c = F$ (Exercise 7.7)
2. for each $\alpha \rightarrow \beta \in F_c$

```C
(A,B,C)
(C,D,E)
(B,D)
(E,A)
// cand_key = A , already contained
```
3. Merge<br>
no containining relationship between them. nothing to do.
