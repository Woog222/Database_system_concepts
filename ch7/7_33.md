Consider the schema $R = (A, B, C, D, E, G)$ and the set $F$ of functional dependencies: 

$$AB \rightarrow CD  \\ADE \rightarrow GDE  \\B \rightarrow GC  \\G \rightarrow DE$$ 

Use the 3NF decomposition algorithm to generate a 3NF decomposition of $R$, and show your work. This means: 

---

#### a. A list of all candidate keys. 

```C++
// Note: {A, B} must be included in every candidate key.
// Additionally, {A, B} is a candidate key by itself.
// Therefore, {A, B} is the unique candidate key.
{A,B}
```

#### b. A canonical cover for $F$, along with an explanation of the steps you took to generate it. 

```C++
/*
B -> CD is implied within the given FD sets, which is stronger than AB -> CD
*/
B->CD // (A deleted)
ADE->GDE
B->GC
G->DE
---
B -> GCD
ADE -> GDE
G -> DE

/*
2. B -> D can be inferred without it.
*/
B -> GC
ADE -> GDE
G -> DE

```

#### c. The remaining steps of the algorithm, with explanation. 

```C++

/* 
1. List the relations created from the computed canonical cover. Add a candidate key set if there is no relation containing any candidate keys.
*/
{B,C,G}
{A,D,E,G}
{D,E,G}
{A,B} // cand key relation 

/*
2. Merge if there exists a containing relationship.
*/
{B,C,G}
{A,D,E,G}
{A,B}
```

#### d. The final decomposition. 

```
{B,C,G}
{A,D,E,G}
{A,B}
```
