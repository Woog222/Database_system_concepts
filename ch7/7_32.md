### 7.32

Consider the schema $R = (A,B,C,D,E,G)$ and the set $F$ of functional 
dependencies: 
$$
A \rightarrow BC \\
BD \rightarrow E \\ 
CD \rightarrow AB \\
$$

---

#### a. Find a nontrivial functional dependency containing no extraneous attributes that is logically implied by the above three dependencies and explain how you found it. 

#### b. Use the BCNF decomposition algorithm to find a BCNF decomposition of $R$. Start with $A \rightarrow BC$. Explain your steps. 

#### c. For your decomposition, state whether it is lossless and explain why. 

#### d. For your decomposition, state whether it is a dependency preserving and explain why.
