### 7.32

Consider the schema $R = (A,B,C,D,E,G)$ and the set $F$ of functional 
dependencies: 
$$
A \rightarrow BC \\
BD \rightarrow E \\ 
CD \rightarrow AB \\
$$

---

#### a. Find a nontrivial functional dependency containing no extraneous attributes that is logically implied by the above three dependencies and explain how you found it. 

$AD \rightarrow E$   

```C++
A->BC //Aug_rule D
AD -> BCD //Decomp rule
AD->BD //trans with BD->E
AD->E
```

#### b. Use the BCNF decomposition algorithm to find a BCNF decomposition of $R$. Start with $A \rightarrow BC$. Explain your steps. 

```C++
(A,B,C) (A,D,E,G)
// done
```

#### c. For your decomposition, state whether it is lossless and explain why. 

```C++
loseless since A is a superkey of the first deomposed relation.
```

#### d. For your decomposition, state whether it is a dependency preserving and explain why. 

Not dependency preserving due to the two functional dependencies $BD \rightarrow E$, $CD \rightarrow AB$.
