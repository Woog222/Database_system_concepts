Although SQL does not support functional dependency constraints, if the database system supports constraints on materialized views, and materialized views are maintained immediately, it is possible to enforce functional dependency constraints in SQL. Given a relation $r(A,B,C)$, explain how constraints on materialized views can be used to enforce the functional dependency $B \rightarrow C$.

```SQL
CREATE VIEW v(B,C) AS (
    SELECT B, COUNT(DISTINCT C) AS cntC
    FROM r
    GROUP BY B
);
-- cntC <= 1
```
