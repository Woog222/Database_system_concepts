7.4 Use Armstrong's axioms to prove the soundness of the union rule. 

---

Suppose $\alpha \rightarrow \beta$ and $\alpha \rightarrow \gamma$.

Let's Apply Augmentation rule to both of them with $\alpha$ and $\beta$ respectively. 
$\alpha \rightarrow \alpha\beta$<br>
$\alpha\beta \rightarrow \beta\gamma$<br>
Then by Transitivity rule, we get  $\alpha \rightarrow \beta\gamma
$
