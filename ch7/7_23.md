Explain what is meant by <b><i>repetition of information</i></b> and <b><i>inability to represent information</i></b>. Explain why each of these properties may indicate a bad relational-database design.

---

+ <b><i>repetition of information</i></b>: when our relation stores the same data redundantly

```
ins_dept(
    ID,
    name,
    salary,
    dept_name,
    building,
)
```

+ <b><i>inability to represent information</i></b> : 
 ```
ins_dept(
    ID, <- Primary key
    name,
    salary,
    dept_name,
    building,
)
```
we can not represent a department without any instructors.
