Although the BCNF algorithm ensures that the resulting decomposition is lossless, it is possible to have a schema and a decompsition that was not generated by the algorithm, that is in BCNF, and is not lossless. Give an example of such a schema and its decomposition.

$R=(A,B,C,D)$  
$F = \{ AB \rightarrow C\}$

$R_1=(A,C) \\ R_2=(A,B,D)$
