Show that every schema consisting of exactly two attributes must be in BCNF regardless of the given set $F$
 of functional dependencies.

---
$R=(A,B)$  

Let's consider an arbitrary non-trivial functional dependency $\alpha \rightarrow \beta$.

Since it's not trivial, $\alpha = \{A\}$ or $\alpha = \{B\}$. WLOG, let's assume that $\alpha = \{A\}$.

Again, since it's not trivial, $\beta = \{B\}$ or $\beta = \{A,B\}$. Both case imply that $\alpha$ is a super key for $R$. 

Therefore, It's not possbile for any functional dependency $\alpha \rightarrow \beta$ to violate the BCNF constraints.
