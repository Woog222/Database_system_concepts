A functional dependency $\alpha \rightarrow \beta$ is called a **partial dependency** 
if there is a proper subset $\gamma$ of $\alpha$ such that $\gamma \rightarrow \beta$; 
we say that $\beta$ is _partially dependent_ on $\alpha$. A relation schema $R$ is 
in **second normal form** (**2NF**) if each attribute $A$ in $R$ meets one of the 
following criteria: 

* It appears in a candidate key. 
* It is not partially dependent on a candidate key. 

Show that every 3NF schema is in 2NF. (_Hint_: Show that every partial dependency is a 
transitive dependency.)

It suffices to show that every partial dependency is a transitive dependency.

Let any non-prime attribute $A$ be given. 

Suppose there exists a candidate key $\alpha$ and its proper subset $\gamma \subset \alpha$ s.t. $\gamma \rightarrow A$. 

We can easily show that $A \wedge \alpha = \empty$ since $A$ is a non-prime attribute, and $\gamma \nrightarrow \alpha$ since $\alpha$ is a candidate key.

Then we get the transitive dependency, $\alpha \rightarrow \gamma \rightarrow A$.
