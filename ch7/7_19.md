A functional dependency $\alpha \rightarrow \beta$ is called a **partial dependency** 
if there is a proper subset $\gamma$ of $\alpha$ such that $\gamma \rightarrow \beta$; 
we say that $\beta$ is _partially dependent_ on $\alpha$. A relation schema $R$ is 
in **second normal form** (**2NF**) if each attribute $A$ in $R$ meets one of the 
following criteria: 

* It appears in a candidate key. 
* It is not partially dependent on a candidate key. 

Show that every 3NF schema is in 2NF. (_Hint_: Show that every partial dependency is a 
transitive dependency.)

Let $A$ be a non-prime attribute associated with a candidate key $\alpha$, where $\gamma$ is a proper subset of $\alpha$ such that $\gamma \rightarrow A$. 

Assume $P$ is the primary key. Given that $P \rightarrow \gamma, \gamma \nrightarrow P$ and $A \notin P, A \notin \gamma$, we establish a transitive dependency involving the primary key and the non-prime attribute A.
