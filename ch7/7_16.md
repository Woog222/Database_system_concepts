### 7.16

Show that it is possible to ensure that a dependency-preserving decomposition
into 3NF is a lossless decomposition by guaranteeing that at least one schema
contains a candidate key for the schema being decomposed. (Hint: Show that
the join of all the projections onto the schemas of the decomposition cannot
have more tuples than the original relation.)
