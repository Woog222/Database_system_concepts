### 7.9 
Given the database schema $R(A,B,C)$, and a relation $r$ on the schema $R$, write an SQL query to test whether the functional dependency $B \rightarrow C$ holds on relation $r$. Also write an SQL assertion that enforces the functional dependency. Assume that no null values are present. (Although part of the SQL standard, such assertions are not supported by any database implementation currently.)

```SQL
CHECK NOT EXISTS (

    SELECT * 
    FROM r as S, r as T
    WHERE S.B=T.B 
        AND S.C <> T.C
)
```
```SQL
CHECK NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT B
    FROM r
    GROUP BY B
    HAVING COUND(DISTINC C) > 1
)
```
```SQL
CREATE ASSERTION ANAME CHECK (
    NOT EXISTS (
        -- above queries
    )
)
```
