### 7.11

In the BCNF decomposition algorithm, suppose you use a functional dependency $\alpha \rightarrow \beta$ to decompose a relation schema $r(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$ into $r_1(\alpha, \beta)$ and $r_2(\alpha, \gamma)$. 

---

#### a. What primary and foreign-key constraint do you expect to hold on the decomposed relations?</b> <br> 

$
r_1(\underline{\alpha}, \beta)$ <br>
$
r_2(\alpha, \gamma) 
$ references $r_1(\alpha)$

#### b. Give an example of an inconsistency that can arise due to an erroneous update, if the foreign-key constraint were not enforced on the decomposed relations above. <br> 

deleting a tuple from $r_1$, where exists some tuples of $r_2$ referencing the deleted tuple.


#### c. When a relation schema is decomposed into 3NF using the algorithm in Section 7.5.2, what primary and foreign-key dependencies would you expect to hold on the decomposed schema? <br>
