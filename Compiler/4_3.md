### 4.3.1

Below is a regular expression grammar containing only the symbols a and b. It uses + instead of the union character | to avoid confusion with the vertical bar used as a metasymbol in the grammar:
```
rexpr -> rexpr + rterm | rterm
rterm -> rterm rfactor | rfactor
rfactor -> rfactor * | rprimary
rprimary -> a | b
```
Extract the left common factor of this grammar.
Can a transformation that extracts left common factors make this grammar suitable for top-down parsing techniques?
After extracting the left common factors, eliminate left recursion from the original grammar.
Is the resulting grammar suitable for top-down parsing?

#### a) 
X

#### b)
yet

#### c)

$$
<rexpr> \Coloneqq <rterm> \ <rexpr'> \\
<rexpr'> \Coloneqq +<rterm><rexpr'> | \ \epsilon \\ 

<rterm> \Coloneqq <rfactor><rterm'> \\ 
<rterm'> \Coloneqq <rfactor><rterm'> | \ \epsilon \\

<rfactor> \Coloneqq <rprimary><rfactor'> \\
<rfactor'> \Coloneqq *<rfactor'> |\ \epsilon \\

<rprimary> \Coloneqq a \ | \ b
 
$$

#### d)

O

### 4.3.2

Repeat Exercise 4.3.1 on the following grammars:

---

#### a)
```
S -> SS+ | SS* | a
```
```
S - > SSA | a
A -> + | *
```
```C
S -> aB
// B -> SAB | e
B -> aBAB | e
A -> + | *
```

#### b)
```
S -> 0 S 1 | 0 1
```
```
S -> 0 A
A -> S 1 | 1
```

```
S -> 0 A
A -> 0 A 1 | 1
```

#### c)
```
S -> S ( S ) S | e
```

```C
S -> A
A -> ( S ) S A | e
```

#### d)
```
S -> ( L ) | a
L -> L, S | S
```

```
S -> ( L ) | a
L -> SA
A -> , S A | e

S -> (L) | a
L -> (L)A | aA
A -> , S A | e
```

### 4.3.3

The following grammar is proposed to remove the "dangling-
else ambiguity" discussed in Section 4.3.2:

```
<stmt> ::= if <expr> then <stmt> 
        | <matched>
<matched> -> if <expr> then <matched> else <stmt>
        | <other>
```

Show that this grammar is still ambiguous.

---

There's a possibility that the nonterminal ```<matched>``` is actually not matched.

```pascal
if E1
then
    // this is the <matched>, but it's not matched
    if E2
    then matched_S1
    else
        if E2
        then S2
// both of the below ones are possible
else S3
        else S3

```
