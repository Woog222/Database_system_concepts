Given relation _s(a,b,c)_, write an SQL statement to generate a histogram showing the sum of _c_ values versus _a_, dividing _a_ into 20 equal-sized partitions (i.e., where each partition contains 5 percent of tuples in _s_, sorted by _a_).


```SQL
SELECT atile, SUM(c) 
FROM (
    SELECT a,b,c ntile(20) over (order by a desc) as atile
    FROM s
    ORDER BY atile
)
GROUP BY atile


```
