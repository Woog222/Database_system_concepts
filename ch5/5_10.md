Using the relation from Exercise 5.9, write an SQL query to generate a report showing the number of shares traded, number of trades, and total dollar volume broken down by year, each month of each year, and each trading day.

```nyse(year,month,day,shares_traded,dollar_volume)``` 

```SQL
-- where is the number of trades?
SELECT 
    CASE
        WHEN GROUPING(year) = 1 THEN 'ALL'
        ELSE year
    END AS year, 
    CASE
        WHEN GROUPING(month) = 1 THEN 'ALL'
        ELSE month
    END AS month,
    CASE 
        WHEN GROUPING(DAY) = 1 THEN 'ALL'
        ELSE day
    END AS day,
    SUM(shares_traded) AS total_shares_traded,
    SUM(dollar_volume) AS total_dollar_volume
FROM nyse
GROUP BY ROLL UP(year, month, day)
