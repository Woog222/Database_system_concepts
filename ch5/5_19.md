Suppose there are two relations _r_ and _s_, such that the foreign key _B_ of _r_ references the primary key _A_ of _s_. Describe how the trigger mechanism can be used to implement the on delete cascade option when a tuple is deleted from _s_.

```SQL
-- r(B) -> s(A)

CREATE TRIGGER del_cascade AFTER DELETE ON s
REFERENCING OLD ROW AS orow
FOR EACH ROW
/*
WHEN EXISTS (
    SELECT *
    FROM r
    WHERE r.B = orow.A
)*/
BEGIN
    DELETE FROM r
    WHERE r.B = orow.A
END
```
