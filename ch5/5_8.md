Given a relation S(student,subject,marks), write a query to find the top 10 students by total marks, by using SQL ranking. Include all students tied for the final spot in the ranking, even if that results in more than 10 total students.

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT student, rank() over (order by total_marks DESC) as ranking
    FROM (
        SELECT student, sum(marks) as total_marks
        FROM S
        GROUP BY student
    )
)
WHERE ranking <= 10
```
