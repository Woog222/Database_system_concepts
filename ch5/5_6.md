Consider the bank database of Figure 5.21. Let us define a view branch_cust as follows:

```SQL
CREATE VIEW branch_cust AS 
    SELECT branch_name, customer_name
    FROM depositor, account
    WHERE depositor.account_number = account.account_number

```    
Suppose that the view is materialized; that is, the view is computed and stored. Write triggers to maintain the view, that is, to keep it up-to-date on insertions to depositor or account. It is not necessary to handle deltions or updates. Note that, for simplicity, we have not required elimination of duplicates.

```SQL
CREATE TRIGGER dep_insert AFTER INSERT ON depositor
REFERENCING NEW ROW AS nrow
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO branch_cust
    SELECT branch_name , nrow.customer_name
    FROM account
    WHERE account_number = nrow.account_number
END

/*
it's inlucded in the official solution given by the author, but I think this trigger is futile. 
Due to the foreign key integrity from depositor (account_number) to account(account_number), any insert into the depositor relation must be preceded by an insertion of  corresponding tuple into the account relation. Hence it may suffice to have the trigger above without the one below.
*/
CREATE TRIGGER insert_into_branch_cust_via_account
AFTER INSERT ON account
REFERENCING NEW ROW AS inserted
FOR EACH STATEMENT
INSERT INTO branch_cust
    SELECT inserted.branch_name,customer_name
    FROM depositor
    WHERE depositor.account_number = inserted.account_number;

```
