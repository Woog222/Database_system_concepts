Consider an employee database with two relations:

```
employee(employee_name, street,city)
works(employee_name,company_name,salary)
```
where the primary keys are underlined. Write a function avg_salary that takes a company name as an argument and finds the average salary of employees at that company. Then, write an SQL statement, using that function, to find companies whose employees earn a higher salary, on average, than the average salary at "First Bank."

```SQL
CREATE FUNCTION avg_salary(company_name VARCHAR(10))
RETURNS NUMERIC(10,2)
BEGIN
    DECLARE avg_salary NUMERIC(10,2);
        SELECT AVG(salary) INTO avg_salary
        FROM works
        WHERE works.company_name = avg_salary.company_name
    RETURN avg_salary
END
```
```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT company_name
FROM works
WHERE avg_salary(company_name) > avg_salary('First Bank')
```
