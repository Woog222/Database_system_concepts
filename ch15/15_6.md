### 15.6

Consider the bank database of Figure 15.14, where the primary keys are 
underlined. Suppose that a $B^+$ -tree index on <i>branch_city</i> is 
available on relation _branch_, and that no other index is available. List 
different ways to handle the following selections that involve negation: 

![alt text](image.png)

#### a. $\sigma_{\neg (branch\_city < "Brooklyn")}(branch)$

+ $\sigma_{(branch\_city \ge "Brooklyn")}(branch)$  
Utilize the B+-tree index to perform a range scan

#### b. $\sigma_{\neg (branch\_city = "Brooklyn")}(branch)$

+ $\sigma_{(branch\_city < "Brooklyn")}(branch)\  \cup \ \sigma_{ (branch\_city > "Brooklyn")}(branch)$  
Perform a full linear scan, excluding tuples where $branch_city = 'Brooklyn'$.


#### c. $\sigma_{\neg (branch\_city < "Brooklyn" \lor assets < 5000)}(branch)$

+ $\sigma_{(branch\_city \ge "Brooklyn")}(branch)$   
Use the B+-tree index to retrieve all tuples, as if executing the above query, while excluding tuples where $assets \geq 5000$.
