### 15.10

Consider the following extended relational-algebra operators. Describe how to 
implement each operation using sorting and using hashing. 

---

a. **Semijoin** ($\ltimes_\theta$): The multiset semijoin operator $r \ltimes_\theta s$
is defined as follows: if a tuple $r_i$ appears $n$ times in $r$, it appears $n$ times in 
the result of $r \ltimes_\theta s$ if there is at least one tuple $s_j$ such that 
$r_i$ and $s_j$ satisfy predicate $\theta$; otherwise $r_i$ does not appear in the result. 




b. **Anti-semijoin** ($\overline{\ltimes}_\theta$): The multiset anti-semijoin operator 
$r \overline{\ltimes}_\theta s$ is defined as follows: if a tuple $r_i$ appears $n$ times 
in $r$, it appears $n$ times in the result of $r \overline{\ltimes}_\theta s$ if there does 
not exist any tuple $s_j$ in $s$ such that $r_i$ and $s_j$ satisfy predicate $\theta$; otherwise
$r_i$ does not appear in the result.
