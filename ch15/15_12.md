Current generation CPUs include an <i>instruction cache</i>, which caches recently used instructions. A function call then has a significant overhead because the set of instructions being executed changes, resulting in cache misses on the
instruction cache.

---
#### a. Explain why producer-driven pipelining with buffering is likely to result in a better instruction cache hit rate, as compared to demand-driven pipelining.

No function calls. Execute the same set of instructions repeatedly.

#### b. Explain why modifying demand-driven pipelining by generating multiple results on one call to next(), and returning them together, can improve the instruction cache hit rate.


Reduce function calls.
