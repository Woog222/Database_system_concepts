### 15.4

The indexed nested-loop join algorithm described in Section 15.5.3 can be inefficient if the index is a secondary index and there are multiple tuples with the same value for the join attributes. Why is it inefficient? Describe a way,
using sorting, to reduce the cost of retrieving tuples of the inner relation. Under
what conditions would this algorithm be more efficient than hybrid merge join?

---


For each outer tuple $t_{out}$, executing a secondary index non-key search may be ineffective, as its disk access is proportional to the number of retrieved tuples.

Hybrid merge can be utilized instead. It involves sorting the outer relation initially and then performing a merge join with the secondary index of the inner relation. The outcome of this process comprises the actual records of the outer relation, supplemented with their corresponding pointers to the records of the inner relation. Subsequently, sorting this result based on the order of the pointers enables the retrieval of the actual records of the inner relation, significantly reducing the seek cost.

We can determine which methods to apply by comparing the cost of sorting the outer relation with the expected inefficiency of the indexed nested loop join on the secondary index of the inner relation.
