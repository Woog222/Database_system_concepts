Consider the following queries. For each query, indicate if column-oriented storage is likely to be beneficial or not, and explain why.

---

#### a. Fetch ID, name, and dept_name of the student with ID 12345.

Possibly. If the primary key is contained in each column table, we can determine the tuples using the ID columns and reconstruct the result accordingly.

#### b. Group the takes relation by year and course_id, and find the total number of students for each (year, course_id) combination.

Certainly. Merge the "year" and "course_id" columns and sort them. Count the distinct values using a linear scan.
