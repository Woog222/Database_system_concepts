### 15.21

The hash-join algorithm as described in Section 15.5.5 computes the natural
join of two relations. Describe how to extend the hash-join algorithm to compute the natural left outer join, the natural right outer join, and the natural full
outer join. (Hint: Keep extra information with each tuple in the hash index to
detect whether any tuple in the probe relation matches the tuple in the hash
index.) Try out your algorithm on the takes and student relations.
