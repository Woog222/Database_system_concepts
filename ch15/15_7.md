### 15.7

Write pseudocode for an iterator that implements indexed nested-loop join, 
where the outer relation is pipelined. Your pseudocode must define the standard 
iterator functions <i>open()</i>, <i>next()</i>, and <i>close()</i>. Show what state
information the iterator must maintain between calls.
