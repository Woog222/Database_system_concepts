### 15.8

Design sort-based and hash-based algorithms for computing the relational division operation (see Practice Exercise 2.9 for a definition of the division operation).

---

Given $R=\{A,B\}$ $S=\{B\}$,

$r \div s = \Pi_{A}(r) - \Pi_{A}((\Pi_{A}(r)\times s ) - r)$

#### sort-based

Sort $r$ by the lexicographical order of $(A,B)$ and sort $s$ by the order of $B$. Then, perform a linear scan on $r$. For each set $\{t_r \in r \ |\ \forall t_1, t_2,\  t_1[B] = t_2[B]  \}$ , check whether it has all tuples of $s$ as its partners.

#### hash-based

to do



s
Construct two hash tables for tuples of $r$ and attributes $A$ or $r$. They are hased 
s
$t_r -> Parition[h_1(t_r[A])]$
$V(A,r) -> partition$
```
t_r ->
