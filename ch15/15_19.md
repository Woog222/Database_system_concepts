### 15.19

Design a variant of the hybrid merge-join algorithm for the case where both
relations are not physically sorted, but both have a sorted secondary index on
the join attributes.

---

$$r \Join s$$ 

1. Perform a merge join on both indices.  
```result = (pointer_r, pointer_s)```
2. Sort the result by the order of ```pointer_r``` and retrieve the actual records of $r$.  
```result = (t_r, pointer_s)```
3. Sort the result by the order of ```pointer_s``` and retrieve the actual records of $s$.  
```result= (t_r, t_s)```
