Let $r$ and $s$ be relations with no indices, and assume that the relations are not sorted. 
Assuming infinite memory, what is the lowest-cost way (in terms of I/O operations) 
to compute $r \bowtie s$? What is the amount of memory required for this algorithm.

During a nested loop join where the smaller relation entirely fits in main memory and is used as the inner relation, $b_r + b_s$ transfers and $2$ seeks are necessary since they all fit into main memory.

Taking into account the space for $b_{out}$ output buffers and additional computation $b_{extra}$, the total main memory space required is $b_{small} + b_{out} + b_{extra} + 1$ ($1$ is the input buffer for the outer relation). The larger relation doesn't need to reside in memory.
