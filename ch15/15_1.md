### 15.1

Assume (for simplicity in this exercise) that only one tuple fits in a block and
memory holds at most three blocks. Show the runs created on each pass of
the sort-merge algorithm when applied to sort the following tuples on the first
attribute: (kangaroo, 17), (wallaby, 21), (emu, 1), (wombat, 13), (platypus,
3), (lion, 8), (warthog, 4), (zebra, 11), (meerkat, 6), (hyena, 9), (hornbill, 2),
(baboon, 12).
